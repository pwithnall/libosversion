libosversion
============

libosversion is a self-contained library to retrieve identifying information
about the current operating system. It currently supports:
 • Linux
 • Darwin
 • iOS
 • Windows
 • Android

It retrieves basic identifying information suitable for logging statistics about
deployment numbers and device compatibility. It is not intended to be a
comprehensive solution for accessing all identifying information about an OS or
its user.

It does not implement any privacy measures — the library is just a way of
accessing identifying information. It is up to the application developer to
treat this information with the diligence and respect to privacy that it
deserves.

It is a mostly-unsupported code dump at the moment, with no build system, tests,
documentation or release infrastructure. If you want to use it, please get in
touch <philip.withnall@collabora.co.uk> and we can get the ball rolling on
adding some of that infrastructure.

libosversion’s API is terrible, and is subject to wild changes in the future.

Dependencies
============

 • glib-2.0 ≥ 2.38.0
 • Various OS-specific system libraries

Licensing
=========

libosversion is licensed under the LGPL; see COPYING for more details.
